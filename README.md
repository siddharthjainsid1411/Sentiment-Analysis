# Sentiment Analysis using NLP

This project implements sentiment analysis on text data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.  
The goal is to classify sentences or reviews into categories such as **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**.  

### Features
- Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization/stemming)
- Feature extraction (Bag of Words / TF-IDF / embeddings)
- Machine learning and deep learning models for classification
- Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
